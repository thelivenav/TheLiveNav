Code is based upon code provided by google.

This is the google javascript v3 API for google maps.

The code can be found here:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript

I have simply edited this code and combined it's various sections to provide the service available on the website.

This is frequently updated, the Google API code remains the property of google, and the website thelivenav.co.uk remains copyright by Michael Gane.
